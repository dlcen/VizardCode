Vizard code for the experiments that I conducted during my PhD.

* **Study 1** disassociates the contribution of optic flow and allocentric location cues.

* **Study 2** investigates the effects of prior experience on the guidance of walking.

* **Study 3** investigates the use of symmetry, target drift and other cues in the guidance of walking.
