## About the study

The study investigates the role of prior experience with the environment in the guidance of walking. Participants were separated into two groups: *Familiar* and *Unfamiliar*. The *Familiar* group were led into the testing room and did all the preparation work inside, so they were familiar with the spatial layout of the testing room before the experiment started. In the contrast, the *Unfamiliar* group did all the preparationo work outside the testing room and were led inside just before the experiment. Therefore, they had no experience with the testing room before the experiment started.

In addition to the prior experience or familiarity with the testing room, another manipulation regards the visibility of the target to which participants were instructed to walk to during the experiment. Here, the target was illuminated by three LED lights attached to it. The three LED lights were in different colours, respectively reg, green and yellow. When participants walking towards the target, the LED lights were illuminated sequentially in a random order. In the *Continuous* condition, the LED lights were illuminated right after the previous one was turned off, so that the target was illuminated continuously. In the *Intermittent* condition, there was an interval between adjacent illumination of LED lights, so that the target was illuminated intermittently.

The visibility of the testing room was also manipulated by the room illumination. The testing room was fully lit (*Lit* condition), lit by strobes (*Strobe* condition), or in pitch black (*Dark* condition).
## About the code

* `ContinuousCondition.py` is the code for the *Continuous* condition.

* `IntermittentCondition.py` is the code for the *Intermittent* condition.

> For the *Lit* and *Dark* conditions, comment out the lines relating to the control of strobes.

* `Recording.py` is the code run on a separate PC to control the experiment and record the data.
